Gaussian Regression and Robotics Project
Overview
This project focuses on monitoring an area and taking accurate measurements using a robotic system. The primary objectives are:

Accurate Measurement Collection: Ensure all hotspots with values above a given threshold are explored and measured.
Efficient Resource Utilization: Decide when and where to deploy sensors to maximize measurement accuracy while minimizing resource use.
We utilize Gaussian Process Regression to provide uncertainty estimates, informing the robot about where to head to next. Various strategies like batching and uncertainty updates are employed to enhance the approach.
